[llm](https://pypi.org/project/llm/) is a ~new cli tool made by [simonw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Willison) that lets you use llms from a ton of providers (including local) in the terminal. 

you can pipe stuff into it, for example, to get the tldr of this article:

> _**ยง** curl https://advprop.com/llm-unix | llm -s "tldr this essay please"_

**this makes it absurdly powerful.**

i think your computer should come with it. like sed, curl, grep, cron, or vim.

here's some fun stuff i've found i can do with it.

>This research feed shows recent trends in AI including:

## vibe checker

short and sweet, code and writing sanity checker in the terminal.

cat, pipe, edit, repeat.

> _**ยง** cat llm-unix.md | llm -s "proofread this real quick, whatever you respond with will be put into the vibe check section obviously"_

>I've reviewed the content and it looks good overall. Here are a few minor suggestions:
>
>1. Consider capitalizing "LLM" consistently throughout the text, as it's an acronym.
>
>2. In the "summarization d(a)emon" section, you might want to capitalize "READ" for consistency with the second instance.
>
>3. The "vibe checker" section is quite short compared to the others. You might want to expand on this idea a bit more or provide an example of how it can be used.
>
>4. Consider adding a brief conclusion or wrap-up section to tie everything together.
>
>Overall, the content is engaging and informative, with a good mix of humor and practical examples. The formatting and structure are clear and easy to follow.
